| defaults | The **defaults** channel is actually three distinct channels, specified in an order that ensures dependencies are solved correctly. These channels are: [main](https://anaconda.org/main), [r](https://anaconda.org/r), and [msys2](https://anaconda.org/msys2). These channels are automatically configured in your .condarc configuration file when you install Anaconda Distribution or Miniconda. |
| [main](https://anaconda.org/main)  / anaconda | Added Sept 26, 2017 with the release of Anaconda 5.0 and conda 4.3.27, and includes packages built by Anaconda, Inc. with the new compiler stack. The majority of all new Anaconda, Inc. package builds are hosted here. Included in Anaconda's defaults channel as the top priority channel. Of interest: https://www.anaconda.com/blog/developer-blog/utilizing-the-new-compilers-in-anaconda-distribution-5/ | 
| [free](https://anaconda.org/free) | Now deprecated -- Packages built with our old compiler stack. Updates and support for this channel ended in July 2019. This channel is not included in Anaconda's defaults channel, and there is no guarantee that packages from this channel will work with packages from Anaconda's defaults channel. | 
| [r](https://anaconda.org/r) | Microsoft R Open conda packages and Anaconda, Inc.'s R conda packages. This channel is included in Anaconda's defaults channel. When creating new environments, MRO is now chosen as the default R implementation. | 
| [mro](https://anaconda.org/mro) | As of Dec. 19, 2017, this is an empty channel. Packages in this channel have been moved to pkgs/mro-archive. New MRO packages are in the pkgs/r channel. |
| [pro](https://anaconda.org/pro) | Indexes of commercial packages (pkgs/pro channel) | 
| [archive](https://anaconda.org/archive) | Sometimes a package that is released onto one of the other channels has an issue that forces Anaconda, Inc. to remove it from the channel. In these cases, the package is archived to this channel for anyone who still needs it. | 
| [mro-archive](https://anaconda.org/mro-archive) | An archive of the full contents of the pkgs/mro channel, taken on Dec 12, 2017. Outdated versions of Microsoft's MRO and MRAN. | 
| [msys2](https://anaconda.org/msys2) | Windows only. Included in Anaconda's defaults channel. Necessary for Anaconda, Inc.'s R conda packages and some others in pkgs/main and pkgs/free. It provides a bash shell, Autotools, revision control systems and the like for building native Windows applications using MinGW-w64 toolchains. |
